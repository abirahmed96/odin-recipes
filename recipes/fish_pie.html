    <h1>British Fish Pie with Mashed Potato Topping</h1>
    <p>This British fish pie is comforting, creamy, chock full of tender seafood, and topped with a pile of fluffy potatoes. I especially liked the big chunks of cod and salmon! The sauce isn't heavy or rich, even though it's really thick and stick to your ribs in texture. It's mildly seasoned, so you can really just enjoy the flavor of the seafood tucked inside.</p>
